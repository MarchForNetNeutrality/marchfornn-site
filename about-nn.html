                <h1><a id="What_is_Net_Neutrality_0"></a>What is Net Neutrality?</h1>
                <p>Net Neutrality is a current policy that places oversight over your <em>Internet Service Providers</em> (ISPs) like Comcast, AT&amp;T, Time Warner, or Verizon.
                    <br> Though the internet is made of a bunch of computers and websites, ISPs control your only ability to access it.</p>

                </center>
                <p>Because ISPs control what you can access on the internet, net neutrality policies ensure they are acting in your best interests and ensure that all internet traffic is treated equally.</p>
                <h1><a id="What_happens_without_Net_Neutrality_10"></a>What happens without Net Neutrality?</h1>
                <p>Without Net Neutrality these ISPs will be able to control exactly how you access the internet.</p>
                <p><strong>Anti-NN is bad for business:</strong> If new entrepreneurs are hoping to start a new business, the ISPs can charge them for a <em>‘Fast-Lane’</em>, which means their webpage will be more accessible to consumers. Unfortunately, for those not paying premium-prices for the <em>‘Fast-Lane’</em>, their webpage will be inaccessbile due to <em>‘Throttled’</em> speeds. (‘Throttled’ speeds are when an ISP purposely slows down your internet speed.)</p>
                <p><strong>Anti-NN is bad for you:</strong> Without NN, ISPs could control the websites you visit. Imagine a typical household that primarily uses Facebook, Netflix, and Youtube.
                    <br> ISPs would be able to sell website access at premium costs. Want to access Netflix and Youtube? Pay $20 a month for the ‘Entertainment Bundle’. Want to access Facebook? Pay $15 a month for ‘Social’.

                <h1><a id="Okay_so_22"></a>Okay, so?</h1>
                <p>Net Neutrality is an essential policy to ensure that the internet is free from ISP control. Net Neutrality offers us the right to browse freely without being blocked from seeing the websites we want to see.</p>
                <p>In mid-August there will be a vote to remove Net Neutrality and we want you to join our efforts to protect it.</p>
